# From Agentic to Autonomous: A Mathematical Framework for Cognitive Agents in Healthcare and Biotechnology

# Abstract

Current agentic AI systems in healthcare and biotechnology remain fundamentally reactive, requiring constant human oversight and limiting their effectiveness in dynamic, safety-critical environments. This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical framework for autonomous cognitive agents that transcend prompt-driven architectures through self-directed reasoning, persistent memory, hierarchical planning, and formal safety verification. Our framework integrates Bayesian decision theory, stochastic memory models, and optimization techniques to enable safe, reliable autonomous operation in complex healthcare and biotechnology applications. Experimental validation across clinical triage, personalized medicine, and autonomous drug discovery demonstrates significant performance improvements: 94.2\% accuracy in emergency triage (vs. 87.3\% baseline), 85\% improvement in personalized treatment planning, and 73\% efficiency improvement in pharmaceutical research, with formal safety guarantees and regulatory compliance.
